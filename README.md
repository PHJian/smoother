This repo is no longer maintained. Please use the [new AndroidX Shapes library](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/graphics#graphics_shapes_version_10_2) that supports setting corner smoothing similar to Figma. Here is a [Medium post](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/the-shape-of-things-to-come-1c7663d9dbc0) that has more details on the new library. Note, this library also is KMP ready!

# Smoother
Simple Jetpack Compose implementation of round rects with smoother corners that match Figma corner smoothing.
